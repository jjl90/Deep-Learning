It was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna Pavlovna Scherer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress Marya Fedorovna.
With these words she greeted Prince Vasili Kuragin, a man of high rank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception.
Anna Pavlovna had had a cough for some days.
She was, as she said, suffering from la grippe; grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used only by the elite.
The little princess went round the table with quick, short, swaying steps, her workbag on her arm, and gaily spreading out her dress sat down on a sofa near the silver samovar, as if all she was doing was a pleasure to herself and to all around her.
"What a delightful woman this little princess is!" said Prince Vasili to Anna Pavlovna.
The young man had not yet entered either the military or civil service, as he had only just returned from abroad where he had been educated, and this was his first appearance in society.
"It is very good of you, Monsieur Pierre, to come and visit a poor invalid," said Anna Pavlovna, exchanging an alarmed glance with her aunt as she conducted him to her.
"Yes, I have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace, and it is very interesting but hardly feasible."
"We will talk of it later," said Anna Pavlovna with a smile.
